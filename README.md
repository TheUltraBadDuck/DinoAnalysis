# Dino analysis.

___

What’s as big as a dinosaur but weighs nothing?

*A dinosaur’s shadow.*

## 1) What is this repo for?

This is the analysis report for several datasets I found. It contains many problems, solutions and improvements. It may have some typos or errors, but this is the best I want to send my learning to everyone.

## 2) Project frame:

- A data problem: This shows what interesting the dataset is, what each feature means and some modification if necessary (filling null values, etc.).
- Analysis: This illustrates the distribution of each feature, and the relationship between the features. This also consists of data modification (transforming into a normal distribution, scaler, outlier treatment, etc.).
- Modeling: This will run the models. In most cases, I use Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree and Random Forest. If the model becomes more complex, I will consider using Neural Network.

## 3) Who can read and use the codes?

- Everyone can. Credit is not necessary but appreciated.
- However, you may need to have a base knowledge of data analyst or data science to understand the projects.
